# Hotel_Admin_API
Hotel reservation API + admin front-end + user front-end

This project was done by a group of 5 in the same traineeship.
I was one of 2 programmers tasked with creating the design and front-end part of the project.


Tools/languages I used in this project:
- javascript
- php
- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- google web fonts
- Adobe XD
- Trello
- BitBucket
- Git
- Scrum
- Affinity photo


Everything to get this project working locally is here. 
Just set up a local mySQL / MariaDB database according to the sql files,
Change the API call url’s and run it from a localhost server program.


IMPORTANT!:
Please note that this projects intention was to be a learning experience for us and it fulfilled it’s purposed in that regard,
but it is not finished to the extend that it has al the basic features you see in the design completely working.
Some extra features are still missing and there are a couple of bugs, but the biggest part of it is there and works.
Fixing everything and adding all of the features would require more time then would be useful for the learning experience.
I hope you can understand.
